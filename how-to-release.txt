- commit all code changes (there will be another commit once the versions are set)

- make sure all module versions are set correctly 
 (Run svn diff against the last release, note that to see the external changes, svn must be run against the top directory. 
  If running log in TortoiseSVN, "Show only affected paths" must be unchecked to see changes in externals)

- run dependency update: UpdateNbVersions.jar
  go to <project folder>\apps and run
  java -jar c:/bin/UpdateNbVersions/UpdateNbVersions.jar .

- set the date as the build in branding
   Czesl\branding\modules\org-netbeans-core-windows.jar\org\netbeans\core\windows\view\ui\Bundle.properties
      CTL_MainWindow_Title=Feat Build 2012-04-16
      CTL_MainWindow_Title_No_Project=Feat Build 2012-04-16
   Czesl\branding\core\core.jar\org\netbeans\core\startup\Bundle.properties
      currentVersion=Feat Build 2012-04-16
 
- commit the whole application (including externals) with comment indicating the version ("Release 2012-02-22")
  - commit the apps directory from Favorites (add it if it is not there), this way all components are commited in one commit
- tag the commit with a "Release 2012-02-22" tag 

- update the platform modules
  - go to apps\czesl\nb_uc
  - check if the used modules changed: compare the previous list of disabled modules, stored in apps\czesl\nb_uc\platform.properties with the current one in czesl\apps\Czesl\nbproject\platform.properties
  - if yes, update the remove section in update.sh
  - run update.sh
- run the bdeploy target on feat (feat > important files > build script > run target > bdeploy)

- try the update
  - copy all nbms from czesl\apps\Czesl\build\updates to the test uc (\ufal\home\hana\public_html\uc\feat-test)
  - download feat from the web
  - update from the test uc (enabling it first)

- deploy to beta uc
  - rename the beta uc folder (to prevent users updating from it when it is in an inconsistent state)
  - copy there all nbms from the test uc
  - rename the folder back
  - ask selected users to test
  
- deploy to the official uc
